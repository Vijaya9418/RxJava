**Rxjava and rx android**

**Rxjava** :- it is the official website which gets updated first , has all the newest stuffs added to it.

**Rxandroid**:- is a piece build onto to it to make rxjava on android easier.
It has added functionality to make it easier like schedular that can schedule the task on the main thread , it makes threading on android very simple.

In Android development, RxJava can be used to simplify handling asynchronous tasks such as network requests, database operations, and UI events. It provides a set of operators that allow you to transform, filter, and combine data streams, making it easier to handle complex asynchronous scenarios.

It provides a reactive programming paradigm that enables developers to handle asynchronous operations and data streams in a more declarative and composable way.


**if it is also use to simplify handling asynchrounous task as network request then what is the difference between coroutines and rxjava?**


Both Coroutines and RxJava are popular options for handling asynchronous tasks in Android development, and each has its own strengths and use cases. Here are some key differences between the two:


**Programming Paradigm:** 


**RxJava** is based on reactive programming, which focuses on working with streams of data and propagating changes throughout the system. 

**Coroutines,** on the other hand, are based on structured concurrency and provide a more sequential and linear programming model.



**API Design:**



**RxJava** uses the Observable pattern, where data is emitted and processed by a stream of operators. It provides a wide range of operators for transforming, filtering, and combining data streams. 

**Coroutines,** on the other hand, provide a lightweight approach to asynchronous programming with suspending functions. You can use suspend modifier to mark functions that can be paused and resumed later.



**Learning Curve:**


**RxJava** has a steeper learning curve due to its extensive set of operators and concepts related to reactive programming. 

**Coroutines**, on the other hand, are generally easier to learn and understand, especially for developers familiar with synchronous programming.



**Integration with Kotlin:**


**Coroutines** are natively supported in Kotlin since Kotlin 1.1, making it easy to adopt and integrate into Kotlin-based projects. 

**RxJava** is written in Java, but it also provides Kotlin extensions to enhance the integration and usage in Kotlin code.



**Library Ecosystem:**


**RxJava** has been around for a longer time and has a mature ecosystem with many libraries and extensions built on top of it. It has a large community and extensive resources available. 

**Coroutines**, while newer, is gaining popularity and has good integration with other Kotlin-based libraries and frameworks.


** Which one is better?**

In terms of which one is better, it depends on the specific use case and the preferences of the development team. Both Coroutines and RxJava are powerful tools for handling asynchronous tasks. If you prefer a more reactive and stream-based approach, RxJava might be a good fit. On the other hand, if you prefer a more sequential and structured programming model, Coroutines might be a better choice.
